                    <h3>Your Rights !</h3>
                    <br />
                    <ul>

                        <li>

                            If officers are at your door, keep the door closed and ask if they are Immigration agents, or from ICE.</li>
                        <br />
                        <li>

                            Ask the agents what they are there for.</li>
                        <br />
                        <li>
                          Opening the door does not give the agents permission to come inside, but it is safer to speak to ICE through the door.
                        </li>
                        <br />
                        <li>If the agents don’t speak your language, ask for an interpreter.</li>
                        <br />
                        <li>If the agents want to enter, ask them if they have a warrant signed by a judge. If ICE agents do not have a warrant signed by a Judge, you may refuse to open the door or let them in. An administrative warrant of removal
                        from immigration authorities is not enough.</li>
                        <br />
                        <li>If they say they have a warrant, ask them to slip the warrant under the door.</li>
                        <br />
                        <li>Look at the top and at the signature line to see if it was issued by a court and signed by a judge. Only a court/judge warrant is enough for entry into your premises. One issued by DHS or ICE and signed by a DHS or ICE employee
                        is not.</li>
                        <br />
                        <li><a href="https://www.aclu.org/files/kyr/kyr_abra-la-puerta.pdf">An example of an order by a judge</a></li>
                        <br /> <li><a href="https://www.aclu.org/files/kyr/kyr_no-abra-la-puerta.pdf">An example of an order by ICE</a></li>
                        <br /> <li>Do not open your door unless ICE shows you a judicial search or arrest warrant naming a person in your residence and/or areas to be searched at your address.</li>
                        <br /> <li>In all other cases, keep the door closed. State: “I do not consent to your entry.""</li>
                        <br /> <li>If agents force their way in anyway, do not attempt to resist. If you wish to exercise your rights, state: “I do not consent to your entry or to your search of these premises. I am exercising my right to remain silent. I
                        wish to speak with a lawyer as soon as possible.”</li>
                        <br /> <li>Everyone in the residence may also exercise the right to remain silent.</li>
                    </ul>
